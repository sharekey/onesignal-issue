## Step 1: Install packages &  Start the Metro Server

```bash
# build + start
yarn restart

# OR just start, when packages are already installed
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

```bash
